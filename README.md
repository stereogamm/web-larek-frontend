# Application Architecture üí°

## The application implements layer separation in the MVP paradigm 

- *Data layer* - responsible for storing and working with data - `Models`
- *View layer* - responsible for displaying data on the page - `View`
- *Binding layer* with access to models and views - `Presenter`

# Base Code üí°

### Base class `Api` ‚úÖ

Implements logic for working with the server. Contains a constructor to create an object with base URL properties and request headers.

- `constructor(baseUrl: string, options: RequestInit = {})`- takes a base URL and global options for all requests (optional).

Also contains `get` and `post` methods, which handle request formation and asynchronous sending, calling the protected method `handleResponse`. The `handleResponse` method asynchronously converts the server response to json format in case of success and returns it, in case of failure - returns the statusText field value.  

### Base class `Component` ‚úÖ

Represents an `abstract` base class for creating components that work with DOM elements. It provides several methods for managing elements on the page. Subclasses can use these methods to manage DOM elements.

Constructor takes container and saves it. The constructor is protected, meaning instances of this class cannot be created directly, but it can be called from subclasses.

An HTML element is passed to the constructor and saved in the private field container. This allows child classes to work with this element.

Contains methods:

- `toggleClass` Method to toggle a class on an element. Uses classList.toggle to add or remove a class depending on the force value.
- `setText` Sets the text content of an element. Converts value to string and assigns it to textContent.
- `setDisabled` Sets or removes the disabled attribute of an element depending on the state value.
- `setHidden` Hides the element by setting its display style to none.
- `setVisible` Shows the element by removing the display property.
- `setImage` Sets the image source and alt text.
- `render` Updates the instance data by copying properties from data to the current object using Object.assign. Then returns the container.

### Base class `EventEmitter` ‚úÖ

This class is an event management system, allowing adding, removing, and calling event handlers.
The constructor creates an empty `Map` object to store events and their subscribers.

- `constructor()={}`

The class is used in the presenter for event handling and in application layers for generating events.
- Method `on` - adds a handler for a specific event.
- Method `off` - removes a handler for a specific event.
- Method `emit` - calls all handlers for the specified event, passing them data.
- Method `onAll` - adds a handler that will be called for all events.
- Method `offAll` - removes all handlers for all events.
- Method `trigger` - creates a trigger function that, when called, initiates an event with a specified name and data.

### Base class `Model` ‚úÖ

This class provides a foundation for creating models that can handle events, making it easier to manage data changes and synchronization. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly, and it is intended to be extended by other classes.

It contains a constructor that takes a `data` object with partial `T` type data and an `events` object responsible for event handling.

- `Object.assign(this, data)` This method is used to copy all enumerable properties from the `data` object into the current instance (`this`).
- `emitChanges(event: string, payload?: object)` A method that notifies when the model has changed by triggering an event.

# Data Layer üí°

### Class `DataHandler` ‚úÖ

Responsible for data and business logic related to products.

Contains the following fields:
- `productList: IItem[]` A list of product card objects displayed on the main page.\
- `basketList: IItem[]` A list of objects representing items in the shopping cart.
- `preview: IItem` The currently opened product card for preview.
- `total: number | null` The total cost of all items.
- `order: IOrder` = { Order object\
        `email: ,\`
        `phone: ,\`
        `address: ,\`
        `payment: ,\`
        `items: [,\`
        `total: \`
    };
- `formErrors: IFormErrors = {}` An object containing form validation errors.

Class methods for interacting with data:

- `setProductList(items: IItem[])` Assigns received data from the server to `productList`.
- `showOneItem(id: string)` Returns the opened product card object for viewing by `id`.
- `addItemToBasket(item: IItem)` Adds a product to the cart.
- `removeItemFromBasket(id: string)` Removes a product from the cart.
- `resetBasket()` Clears the cart.
- `resetOrder()` Clears order data after successful completion.
- `getTotalSum()` Calculates the total cost of all products.
- `getCountBasketItems()` Returns the number of items in the cart for displaying the counter on the main page.
- `validationOrderInfoIsChecked()` Checks if the payment method and address fields are filled.
- `validationUserInfoIsChecked()` Checks if the email and phone fields are filled.
- `setOrder()` Adds the product `id` to the order field.
- `setPreview(id: string)` Saves the `id` of the opened product card.
- `getPreview()` Retrieves the `id` of the opened product card.
- `getBasketList()` Retrieves the list of cart items.
- `setPaymentType(value: string)` Saves the selected payment type.
- `get payment()` Retrieves the current payment method.
- `set _total` Updates the total cost of products.

## Communication Layer ü´±üèª‚Äçü´≤üèΩ 

This layer is responsible for server interaction.\
All interactions are event-driven.

1. **Fetching data ‚Üí Generating events ‚Üí Performing actions**\
2. **Data in the model changes ‚Üí Event is generated ‚Üí Actions are performed**

---

## Component Interaction üí°

The code describing the interaction between the view layer and the data layer is located in the `index.ts` file, which acts as a presenter.\
Interaction is carried out using events generated by an event broker and event handlers described in `index.ts`.\
In `index.ts`, instances of all necessary classes are first created, and then event handling is configured.
